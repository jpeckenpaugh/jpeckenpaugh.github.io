      "Life Boost adds 10 HP to your max life, and Strength adds 10 points to both Attack and Defense.",
      "Let me break it down: these effects cost MP to cast, and they stack. With a few casts, you’ll be strong enough to trample some monsters.",

      "If you take me with you, I’ll teach you these two spells and we can take down some enemies together. They’ll reward us with XP and GP. While battling, we can also recruit two more baby mushrooms using the “Socialize” feature. Once you have three baby mushrooms on the team, the priestess at the temple can merge us into a stronger Mushroom.",
